# Geolocating
I have often come across datasets that contain addresses, IP-addresses or even both. It can be very useful to visualize this data and to do this we need longitude and latitudes of the addresses/IP-addresses.

I have written two small scripts in R and Python that can do this. The R script also contains a very nice and compact code to create an interactive heatmap of your geolocations.
